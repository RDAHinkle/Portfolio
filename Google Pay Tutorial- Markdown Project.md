# How to Set Up Google Pay on Android

Using a mobile device to pay is a new and preferable way to pay for many people across the globe. Users can pay for goods, services, and other items with Google Pay. Downloading it to an Android device and using it is very fast and easy. Google Pay is only available to users with Android devices so iPhone users are unable to use Google Pay; however, there are other payments apps out there to use. 

## Setting up Google Pay on Android

First step is to go to the Google Play Store and search for "Google Pay" in the search bar. [The Google Pay app will have the Google logo with Pay next to it.](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.google.android.apps.walletnfcrel).

Hit the download button and wait for the download to complete. Once the app has been downloaded, follow the following steps to get the payment information set up on Google Pay:
1. Open Google Pay on an Android device.
2. In the top left tab of the screen, hit the Menu button, and select Payment Methods.
3. Next to the payment methods, select Enable contactless for contactless payments. 
4. Follow the instructions on the screen to set up payment information using the information from the debit or credit card of choice. 
5. Then follow the instructions to verify the payment information. 

## Paying in a Store

Now that Google Pay has been downloaded and the payment information has been added, users can pay in stores with Google Pay. 
1. When ready to check out, unlock the phone. Users do not need to open the Google Pay app. 
2. Hold the back of the phone close to the card reader, and wait for the blue checkmark to appear. This will only be a few seconds. This shows that the payment was received. If the blue checkmark does not come up, hold the device a different way or angle until the blue checkmark appears. If needed, the Google Pay can be closed and reopened to try again. 
3. Once the blue checkmark appears, the payment is completed. 

Some stores might have older software, and will ask users to follow a few additional steps to complete the payment. If asked, follow the additional instructions that appear on the keypad. For debit cards, users will have to enter their PIN, and for credit cards, users will have to give a signature. 

If a user is in a store and the cashier reports that the payment did not go through, make sure that the store accepts mobile payments
